<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>This guide is for students who have special requirements on 3D printing or want to achieve a higher printing speed and quality. For a basic tutorial, look at the Student Worker Training Manual.</p>



<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>



<h3 id="modeling">Modeling</h3>

<p>In order to print with 3D printer, you need to prepare a 3D model.  <br>
The recommended website is <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/"><strong>Thingiverse</strong></a>. It’s a open model community where everyone can upload and download models people made.</p>

<p>If you want to make your own model, following softwares are recommended:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a> (A free easy to use online tool for beginners to easily build 3D models, a part of the 123D utilities) <br>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.123dapp.com/">Other 123D Tools</a> (Sculpt, Catch, Make and Meshmixer are great tools for this use)</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> (A miracle of opensource. It’s a cross platform all-in-one 3D studio that is super powerful. A bit hard to learn though. Tutorial available for NYU students on Lynda.com. Not the best when you need to deal with real precise sizes.)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/all">Autodesk software</a> (Mostly free for students!) <br>
<ul><li>Alias (Good for designing especially when dealing with curved surfaces. Normal meshes are also supported)</li>
<li>Autocad (Professional CAD software)</li>
<li>3DS Max (Good for polygons, but same as Blender, not good for CAD use)</li>
<li>Maya (Not good for CAD use)</li></ul></li>
<li>Rhino (A bit similar to Alias. It will be available on some IMA computers in the near future)</li>
<li>Solidworks (Professional 3D CAD software. Very suitable for creating 3D printable models)</li>
</ul>

<p>When creating the model, you have to notice one thing is that the mesh needs to be closed. A single piece of mesh is not 3D printable because it doesn’t contain any thickness information. The mesh’s definition is similar to the surface in math.</p>

<p>Here is an example: <br>

The green one is correct and red one is a bad example.</p>

<p>You say you can’t see the difference? OK here is the close-up: <br>

The green one has thickness.</p>

<h3 id="creating-support">Creating Support</h3>

<p>Because of the way 3D printer works, one thing you need to care about is the supporting structure. Though Cura we use to generate G-Code has support generation, it is very hard to be removed. Use the knife in the cabinet near the printer. There is also a pair of protecting gloves.</p></div></body>
